# 🛰️ Spaceborn - Beyond Autonomous

**Spaceborn - Beyond Autonomous** is a student-founded startup exploring the future of **AI-enabled autonomous drones** for security, surveillance, and intelligent monitoring. Our mission is to build systems that go beyond manual control—merging computer vision, embedded intelligence, and advanced robotics to create truly autonomous aerial solutions.

---

## 🚀 Our Vision
We aim to redefine aerial security through innovation in:
- **Autonomous Navigation** — Drones capable of perceiving, planning, and adapting in real time.  
- **AI-Driven Surveillance** — Integrating machine learning to detect, track, and respond to anomalies autonomously.  
- **Edge Computing Integration** — Running intelligence directly on-board with minimal latency.  
- **Collaborative Swarm Intelligence** — Coordinating multiple drones for collaborative missions.
